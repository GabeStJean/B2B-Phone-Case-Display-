# Custom Product Display Component for B2B Commerce Web Store
This application is a custom product display component for Salesforce Experience Cloud, and it is built using Lightning Web Component (LWC) and Apex. This video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?) showcases the component displaying an array of phone cases for a fictional web store.


The goal of this project is to create a customized category landing page for an Experience page that provides additional features compared to the out of the box product display component in Experience builder. These features are a pop-up pillbox display for a selected facet, number count display for the amount of products available for a series of facets, and a interface for text prompt filtering for the display.

To achieve this goal, the product display component had to be built from scratch using LWC and Apex. Apex was needed so that Connect REST API could be used to integrate with the B2B Commerce Web store's catalogue (the webstore was create on Salesforce and hosted on a Experience site) to allow the LWC to display products from the web store.
